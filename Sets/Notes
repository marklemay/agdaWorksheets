-- exercise: Define _⊓_ : ℕ → ℕ → Set such that n ⊓ m ≡ k iff k is the minimum of n and m! 
-- Souldn't it be _⊓_≡_ : ℕ → ℕ  → ℕ → Set like how the inhabited set of additions was defined.

-- Exercise: TODO: Define a Bool indexed family of sets with two parameters, A and B, such that the set indexed by false contains an A element and the set indexed by true contains a B element!
--data Solution3 (A B : Set) : Bool → Set where --I think this signature is right But I thought you couldn't take members of one type and put them in another
